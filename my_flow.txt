Flow and Architecture of the Project:

1. The user provides the path of a .pptx file as input to the script.
2. The script uses the "python-pptx" package to parse the presentation and extract its data.
3. The script goes through each slide separately:
    It extracts all the text from the text boxes on the slide.
    It creates a prompt for GPT by combining the extracted text from the slide.
    It sends an asynchronous request to the OpenAI API using the gpt-3.5-turbo model, with a timeout for the response.
    It extracts the AI's reply from the response.
    If any error occurs during processing a slide, it saves an informative error message for that slide.
4. The script gathers the explanations for all the slides in a list.
5. The script saves the list of explanations in a JSON file with the same name as the original presentation.

Files in the Project:

1. main.py: This is the main script file that executes the entire process.
2. pptx_helper.py: This file contains helper functions to parse the PowerPoint presentation using the "python-pptx" package.
3. gpt_helper.py: This file contains helper functions to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API.
4. utils.py: This file contains utility functions used by the main script.
5. output.json: This file stores the explanations for each slide in JSON format.

Breakdown of the Project:

main.py:
Imports the necessary modules and packages.
Defines the command-line interface using argparse to accept the path of the .pptx file as input.
Parses the .pptx file using functions from pptx_helper.py.
Initializes the list to store the explanations.
Processes each slide asynchronously:
Extracts the text from the slide using pptx_helper.py.
Creates a prompt for GPT by combining the extracted text.
Sends an asynchronous request to the GPT-3.5 API using gpt_helper.py.
Extracts the AI's reply from the response.
Handles errors and saves informative error messages, if any.
Appends the explanation or error message to the list of explanations.
Saves the list of explanations to output.json.

pptx_helper.py:
Contains functions to parse the .pptx file using the "python-pptx" package.
Function: parse_presentation(pptx_path) - Parses the .pptx file and returns a list of slides.
Function: extract_text(slide) - Extracts the text from a slide's text boxes and returns a list of text strings.

gpt_helper.py:
Contains functions to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API.
Function: generate_explanation(prompt) - Sends a request to the GPT-3.5 API and returns the AI's reply.

utils.py:
Contains utility functions used by the main script.
Function: save_json(file_path, data) - Saves the given data as JSON in the specified file path.
Function: remove_whitespace(text) - Removes any weird whitespaces from the given text.
Function: clean_text(text) - Cleans the text by removing unnecessary characters and extra whitespaces.

output.json:
The output file that stores the explanations for each slide in JSON format.
